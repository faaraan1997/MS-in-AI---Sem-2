So based on that, it's, in duration, sharing, you find the cell information as of I event x as this equation I(x) equal to the log of the probability of x. So I(x) is a cell of information, and the p(x) is a probability of human x So that you see off the information output is a piece of information received from the event x. So for example, if we want to send the code of 0010 or by channel. So event of 0010 is a series of code of that. And in this case, the last is And it's able to move forward. Right? So the encoding is a bit 0 or 1 that occurs with a probability of 1 over 2. So the point is, in this case, The p the probability should be, 1over 2 with the power n.  So then we we can calculate the state of information of I(x). The x is 0010, and again, it's it's the equation, and here is various probability. So eventually, we calculate this, gathers just a poppets. So that means the same information out of the event of 0. 90. No. That's a good question. Okay. So the sales information is for, to document how the information how big it is."

Right? Because this is the biggest number. So as soon as that is a data example, I invented the likelihood of the data. I give him the more apparent that's it. I can't even rewrite the whole system here, And there's a logo, often used because it is the numerical calculations since the transmons are productive as many terms in imagine, for example, like this one. Because here we are, change this, like, product to, like, summation. So it should be much easier to calculate. That's the real that's the reason why we use a lot of likelihood here. So, eventually, it becomes the true summation of yi and log of yi had here. So our net view of lot likelihood allow allow us to minimize our approach that is negative. So inventory, there should be just a equal to the But the cross entropy loss here. So last, maximizing the likelihood is the same as the minimize, cross entropy plus, so here is a quick group of your time.

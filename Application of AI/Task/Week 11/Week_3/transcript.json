And the filtering is like a neighborhood operation in which the value of any given pixel in the output image is detected by applying some algorithms to the values of the pixels in the neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel.

Because if we know the noise that has been added, then it should be easy to subtract. Yeah, it can be or it cannot be. So let's say it's a rhythm. That can be true, but the case is we don't know the noise function. But even if we know the noise function, have you definitely got the original? No? Why? What exactly? So we might get near to the original, but we don't know the pixels that exactly needs to be subtracted. Let's continue to see more answers there. As the first answer to this question, so why not? Because the additive noise destroys information and there is no way to recover it. You get the point? So why? I see some confusion. The previous question. Why? The question is, even if you know the noise function, can you definitely recover the original image or original data? I have it here. It depends on the noise function. Even if you know the noise function. Remember the previous question we mentioned about the image. You have an image here that is consistent. This is the original image. Even if you know this noise function, can you definitely get this one? Suppose you already have this one. Can you definitely get the original clear one? Yes or no? It depends on the function.

The question is, can you definitely get this I prime here? Yes or no? In an ideal condition, it should give the right answer. It depends on how it's reversing or changing the information.

Now you can push the pixel values beyond those limits so that it will destroy the information. So even if we have it, the image still cannot be completely recovered. Now, did you get the point? Yes. Good. It's a search. What's the end of the range? Okay. So did you get the point why we still cannot recover it? So now this is a simple equation. Why we cannot get an eyebrow here? Do you know the reason? Yes. You know? Yes. This is just missed here. For example, these images have finite limit of allowed pixel values. So just to specifically give an example, like 255 is the limitation. If let's say you have like, your original image number, let's say you have like 255 as an integer, right?

So combine all the weighted pixels to come up with new value of pixels. So when all pixels have the same weight, then it is like calculated similar as before. Because previously we treated all of them as equally right. So there is no weight between different points, right? For example, the middle five, we treated them equally in this case.

But if we assign different kind of weight, we might have a different story. So let's think what the details. Notice that the number of weights are usually open. Why? Do we have some quick answers? Why are they always open? For example, we usually take five of it or take three. So why do we need it? Say it loudly. The number of left and right, you said? The number of right and left is equal. Yes, similar like that. The key thing is that it will be easy for you to try to balance your left and right in that case. And we will review that again later about why.",

So in this example, we are given some weight to all nearby pixels. But in fact, some pixels are more closer than the other. So in this case, how about giving more weight to the pixels that is more closer? So this is the reason why we want to assign different weights to different points. Let's say if like this point, this should be middle, right? We might need to assign more weights of the nearby examples. Is that correct? I want to pause a little bit. Do you have some questions? This one. Yeah. Okay. Maybe we can expand like use this. You know, it's a file. That's a. This one. Yeah, on the center. So that's good. I saw you in the waste list. So for example, this is the middle. You probably want to assign more weights to this to right. Because you close to the center and we assign less weight to this one. But.

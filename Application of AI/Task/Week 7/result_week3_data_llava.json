Kernel density estimation constructs a smooth estimate of the underlying distribution by placing a kernel function at each data point and summing their contributions to estimate the probability density function.\n<image>"

When the process is repeated a large number of times, each outcome occurs with a relative frequency, or so-called probability.    If a particular outcome occurs more often, we say it is more probable. So, the probability arises through a contest.First of all, in an actual repeated experiment (for example, recalling the color of 1,000 cars driving by), if 57 out of 1,000 are green, then you estimate the probability of a car being green as 57 divided by 1,000. Eventually, you get a small number, and this is the so-called probability here.In the idealized conceptions of a repeated process, for example, considering the behavior of an unbiased 6-sided die, the probability of rolling a 5 is 1 over 6.That should be the same. Another example is when you need a model for how people's heights are distributed. You choose a normal distribution to represent the expected radio probabilities\n<image>"

And then here is the clear on how we calculate the variance here. Once the virus is low, the value of f(x) faster near the expected value. And, the you already the variance is the commonly the nature they use is sigma squared here, and then the above, we create a similar to a bunch of x. F(x) is equal to xi minus mu here. Expand. Mu is Just the main line here. That is a cosmine line, this one. And we have, like, sigma square can be rewriting this equation, and this is similar to the formula of calculating the variance of sample of observation. So as you guys might be familiar with this So I write out particular various, you know, parts of the data. And here is how we define the the standard deviation. That's just a single here.

Right? Like a frame or a coin, just to have two sides there. Distribution is called the category code distribution or generalized distribution. Is probability distribution that describes the possible results of, random variables that can take in, one of k possible categories. So a category of random variable is a discrete random variable with more than 2 possible outcomes such as the role of value. As a, for example, in a monkey class classification in machine learning, we have set out that example x1x to your accent and the least corresponded that an example x I has a k class level. That is a yi is equal to yi1  yi2 to  yik. That k just rescale different clusters corresponding to 1 hot encoding. In one hot encoding is called, 1 hot k vector, we have one element that has the value of 1 and all other has the value of 0. That's the name as a probability of assigned, class level to a data point as a p one to p k. So we will know that is a, p a p j should be between 0 and 1, and the sum of the p j should be equal to 1 for the different classes. Right? From j, that is equal from 1 to k, the marginal probability of the data point to x I is the probability of x I that it's gonna be, Like, some product of all the probability here. Right? So, similarly, we can take place of all data Examples as this kind of products of all of them together.\n<image>"

So, that dimension narrative reduction measures, for example, the, the PCA, and there's, feature corrections, feature subset actions, numerous key reflections or regression and the log linear models, the histogram, clustering, Then the cube aggregation, so data compression, I will first try to quickly give you a overview of those different measures.

I suppose, basically, if we have some kind of or do you get that once we use some lossless or all results? We get some compressed data. Right? If it is above most of the messes, we can also recover the Confess data back to the original data arrived. Like, sometimes in your computer, you Zip a file. Not a file. Eventually, the ends of it, so you get some kind of similar information. But for the last thing, this means that if you Compressed, your data, for example, your compress, your big big, you just model it. So you measure who will have lost the revolution of your visual video. Right? So this is a causal.\n<image>"

And then, so in this case, we use a yellow logistic regression model LRM, and we're trying to fix the x-train and the y-train. So that way, we'll gather some predictions from another model so that we can compare the ROC curves for them. Also, one line of code. Okay?

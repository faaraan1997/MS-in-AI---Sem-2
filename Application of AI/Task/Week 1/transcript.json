My research and regular focus are on these 4 directions. So first of all, I'll majority of my papers, I focus on transfer learning. So specifically, I focused on as more domain for the domain adaptation. So later I will explain what the domain adaptation meaning here. Next, I am interested in manifold learning, which is kind of an expansion of space is different from our training space. And next, I am interested in the shape analysis, and this is really, relatively related to the medical field. And lastly, recently, I'm more focused on the audio denoising problem.",

When the process is repeated a large number of times, each outcome occurs with a relative frequency, or so-called probability.    If a particular outcome occurs more often, we say it is more probable. So, the probability arises through a contest.First of all, in an actual repeated experiment (for example, recalling the color of 1,000 cars driving by), if 57 out of 1,000 are green, then you estimate the probability of a car being green as 57 divided by 1,000. Eventually, you get a small number, and this is the so-called probability here.In the idealized conceptions of a repeated process, for example, considering the behavior of an unbiased 6-sided die, the probability of rolling a 5 is 1 over 6.That should be the same. Another example is when you need a model for how people's heights are distributed. You choose a normal distribution to represent the expected radio probabilities",

In probability theory, it provides a mathematical framework for representing and quantifying uncertain quantities, and there are several different sources of uncertainties.For example, the first one can be the inherent stochasticity in the system being modeled. Another concrete example is that most interpretations of quantum mechanisms describe the dynamics of some atom particles as being probabilistic.Another reason causing uncertainty can be the incompleteness of observability. Even deterministic systems can appear stochastic when we cannot observe all the variables that affect the behavior of the system. Another reason can be incomplete modeling. When we use models, we may not capture all the information we observe, leading to uncertainty in the model's predictions. For example, the discretization of real number values, dimension reduction, etc. Because we always discard unnecessary information. So, while it may seem unnecessary, in terms of data itself, it can be useful.",

A random variable, denoted as x, is a variable that can take different values.For example, x can represent drawing time. The possible values of x comprise a sample space. For instance, consider the outcome space, denoted as S, which is equal to 1 to 6 because it represents a six-sided die with six different values.So, we denote the event of rolling a 5 as x equal to 5 or x being equal to 5 with this equation.The probability is denoted as P, and it is used to express the likelihood of events. Additionally, the notation P(x) can be used to denote the probability distribution of the random variable x. It signifies that x has a probability of P(x). For a random variable, there can be both discrete and continuous types. Discrete random variables have a finite number of possible values. For example, the sides of a die represent a finite number of states. On the other hand, continuous random variables can have an infinite number of possible states. For instance, the height of a person can vary infinitely",

For example, if you have a training, let's say, in our typical machine learning, you only have act tracking sample acts here. Right? I mean, in the domain adaptation, we will have 2 to different domains. We have the source domain. We have a fact domain.

For example, the cross entropy is the closer we like to the kind of k l divergence, and then it is defined as the summation of the entropy h p, and the kl that bridges KLP over q here, and eventually can be rewriting in this way. Automatically, we can write the, cross entropy in this case. So somehow, you might see this. You create, and you might help us. Right? So you you donated this cross entropy loss there. So in machine learning, it has a classification based on set up at the point x1, x2 to xn, that needed to be classified into k classes. So for each of them, example x I, we have a class level y I here, which means that your level y follows that your your distribution p here. The goal is to pass by the for example, a neural network, parameters lies here. That out, outputs are predict plus level yhat i, but it's there's a somewhat inside. So that predict the level y hat follows the estimated distribution of q. So in this case, the cross entropy loss between the, true distribution p and the estimated distribution q is calculated using this cost and a loss here. And, usually, we will try to minimize them Because the smaller the better are right.",

For example, So at max, state of p are these the given the model and data, but classification problem from previous page, we want to find the parameters data. So that for the example here, the probability of up to the class level x y,  to y and x next line, Which means that we try to kind of, the correct levels, by using kind of models that that you said, for some dead examples of predict class and yihat, we have the different, than the true class yi, but the goal is to find the data that, results in an overall maximum probability. So overall, this is like the we're sort of the at max of p given the model of data that is proportional to this kind of mathematics, is probability. And this is the true this the p one g p n does not depend on the parameter data, And then we can assume that we have no prior, assumption with on which set our parameter thetas that, that are better than any others. Because that the key here is a likelihood, and therefore, the maximum likelihood Estimation, etcetera, is based on solving this kind of problem.

Given j is becoming from 1, 2 to the k. K means different k classes here. For example, we have here the problem is 3 class that is also achieved an image of a car x I, and the true level is gonna be 1 0 0. Let's assume our product predict the level should be like this one. 0.7, 0. 1, and 0. 2. And then the probability according to this equivalent, we should calculate Just a power to 0.7. Right? So now we can preview this level as which class. This is which class. Yeah. But that prediction is like this way. This should be which class. Of course. The first yeah. The first should be the. Right? Because this is the biggest number. So as soon as that is a data example, I invented the likelihood of the data. I give him the more apparent that's it. I can't even rewrite the whole system here, And there's a logo, often used because it is the numerical calculations since the transmons are productive as many terms in imagine, for example, like this one. Because here we are, change this, like, product to, like, summation. So it should be much easier to calculate. That's the real that's the reason why we use a lot of likelihood here. So, eventually, it becomes the true summation of yi and log of yi had here. So our net view of lot likelihood allow allow us to minimize our approach that is negative. So inventory, there should be just a equal to the But the cross entropy loss here. So last, maximizing the likelihood is the same as the minimize, cross entropy plus, so here is a quick group of your time.

If you could define classification or most classification, but task is to define all the data to Sound Plus. Yeah. That's good. We'll answer. What about other thoughts? What are the difference between regression and the classification? They don't know what is classification?Yeah. Okay. We catch a big surprise here. What about and as a and as a also, so how about that given speaking regression and classification? I think for regression is that your predict predicted target is the numerical data. And for the classification is the, Like, your predicted target is, is not the numerical data. It is the ordinary or the or the classification data. Is that correct? Yeah. It's kinda so I will answer this question later. So now let's first talk about this classification. We want to classify things classification. So now let's talk about what are the differences between regression and classification. And for regression, the output is very continuous number. There can be any continuous number. Right? But for the classification, it can be just a nominal, which means that it can be 1,2,3. You get the difference here? Okay. Good. For the regression, so the, typically, the easy one is just a normal linear regression, which means just So why then could you could you add x plus bit? What about the market pattern, regression? That means that just that we have a different, regression in mice, different variables in the regression. But about binomial, binomial is missing We have different degrees of the regression. Right? As you can see, you know, the logic is in this review, polynomial. And about the classification, some measures like, classification, It's like k k nearest neighbor or some decision tree classification, some random cross classification. So during the classification, we're really more likely to find this boundary if you give it a class. Right? But, of course, our regression, we really want to figure out data. Right.

You take the the diagonal elements then divide the all that together as an accurate. That's it. Good. So, another use for directions is trying to measure some other metrics such as the precision.

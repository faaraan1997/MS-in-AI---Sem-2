These include representing binary outcomes with associated probabilities, where one outcome (typically labeled as 1) has a probability of 'p' and the other outcome (typically labeled as 0) has a probability of '1-p'. The distribution is parameterized by a single parameter 'p', which represents the probability of success for the outcome labeled as 1. Additionally, the Bernoulli distribution is discrete, meaning it models events with a finite number of possible outcomes.

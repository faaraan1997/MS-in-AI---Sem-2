Is probability distribution that describes the possible results of, random variables that can take in, one of k possible categories. So a category of random variable is a discrete random variable with more than 2 possible outcomes such as the role of value. As a, for example, in a monkey class classification in machine learning, we have set out that example x1x to your accent and the least corresponded that an example x I has a k class level. That is a yi is equal to yi1  yi2 to  yik. That k just rescale different clusters corresponding to 1 hot encoding. In one hot encoding is called, 1 hot k vector, we have one element that has the value of 1 and all other has the value of 0. That's the name as a probability of assigned, class level to a data point as a p one to p k. So we will know that is a, p a p j should be between 0 and 1, and the sum of the p j should be equal to 1 for the different classes. Right? From j, that is equal from 1 to k, the marginal probability of the data point to x I is the probability of x I that it's gonna be, Like, some product of all the probability here. Right? So, similarly, we can take place of all data Examples as this kind of products of all of them together.",

What are the difference between regression and the classification? They don't know what is classification?Yeah. Okay. We catch a big surprise here.

The study called the form was the random choice, and the y is up 1 above it performs better across the best class by has the odds that's paid as a segment to [0,0] between [0,1] and [0,1] - [1,1] and the algorithm should have been as close as a positive to this limit. So, actually, we want to find a line that is very close to this one. Very close to this one. [0,1] and [1,1]. Yeah. Get it. You got it right.

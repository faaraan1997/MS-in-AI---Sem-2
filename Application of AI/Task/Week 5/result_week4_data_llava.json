Your x is equal to the transpose of the x0 and x1. What is x0? How do you guess about x0? What is f0 here? It is can the file issued by the way, you replied as a box. So it's it's the x there is to find a box. So previous but in your version, we may have, w*x + b. Right? So this b, the bias so, eventually, the b, we are can be incorporated with x. We combine them together. So that we will find that, You know, waiting. Your first dimension should be, like, 1. So that is the box. Give me example. Let's say h of f h is theta x Yes.

That is mapping from x to y, and the way x should be a vector of real a very the features from x, man, to x end, And the y case, what it function is is just 0 or is just 1. So assume our x I are conditional independent in a given y, and the model xi depends on the given y, is equal to y k as a function. Is this one. Right?

So here is the overall representations of the logistic regression hypothesis, And we have this, like, at theta_1, theta_1 to theta_n and x_n here. Right? So you're wondering this problem. How we can get this kind of functions here? So let's try to consider value from a function f. That is mapping from x to y, and the way x should be a vector of real a very the features from x, man, to x end, And the y case, what it function is is just 0 or is just 1. So assume our x I are conditional independent in a given y, and the model xi depends on the given y, is equal to y k as a function. Is this one. Right? And we also try to model p y, the probability of y, that's only function as pi. When I use p y is equal to pi. Right. So let's say it was going on about the probability of y giving x, y, and q to x n.\n<image>"

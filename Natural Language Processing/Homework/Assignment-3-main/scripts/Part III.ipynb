An example is the Naive Bayes and Bag-of-Words representation.\n",

For example, the percentage of data split between a training and test set is a heuristic -- or rule of thumb-- where we often choose 80% of the labeled data to train our model, and 20% to test it.\n",

That’s because we are essentially throwing in the collection of words into a ‘bag’, selecting a word at random, and then calculating their frequency to use in the Bayesian Inference.
